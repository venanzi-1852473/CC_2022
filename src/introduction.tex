%Given some problem, we want to know the amount of computational resources needed in order to solve it.
%In general it's an hard question, so it gets relaxed in various ways.

%We also (often) use concrete models of computation with \textit{limited resources}.

%The way we often treat problems is by assuming a conjecture; \eg if $P \neq NP$ then "this problem is hard".
