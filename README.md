# Computational Complexity (a.y. 2022-23)

This document contains notes taken during the *Computational Complexity* course, held by Massimo Lauria during the academic year 2022-23.
Page of the course at this [link](https://www.massimolauria.net/complexity2022/) (if the link is broken it might be that too much time has passed and the link has been updated for another academic year).

These notes are not meant to be comprehensive, but rather a sort of compendium of the most important definitions and aspects of the course.
There are many theorems, proof and examples missing here; so this is really more for helping memorize the key concepts.

As of right now there are no citations to bibliographic sources. I intend to put them in the future, but since, as mentioned above, this document alone is not enough to study the subject,
I recommend checking professor Lauria's page of the course, which well documents the most important citations to the books that he used during the course.
